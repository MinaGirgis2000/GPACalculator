- This is an unfinished calculator for your GPA
- It's a short and easy way to just pull up a window and insert all your information in to get your approximate GPA.

This is currently incomplete, it's just the template that I created which is going to help me make all the calculations. There will be customizations made, but I usually like doing those type of things at the end to prevent from any mix-ups I may have.

If you're interested, if you want for me to put in specific GPA grade for each course grade (such as in Academic an A- is a 3.7, but in Honors, it's 4.255. I will take course levels from Academic to Advanced Placement. If there are any other course levels you would like for me to add, let me know.
