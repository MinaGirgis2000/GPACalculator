- It's a short and easy way for you to pull up a window and insert all your grades in to get your approximate GPA.

I will be applying a few more customizations to it in the future. It currently very plain, but everything should still work. Let me know if you want me to add more classes instead of just 8 classes. The .jar file will not be available, probably until next week because I have school finals to study for.

If you're interested, if you want for me to put in specific GPA grade for each course grade (such as in Academic an A- is a 3.7, but in Honors, it's 4.255. I will take course levels from Academic to Advanced Placement. If there are any other course levels you would like for me to add, let me know.
